# Data Wrangling and MongoDB

This is the second project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the [Data Wrangling with MongoDB](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032) course from Udacity.  In this project we use data munging techniques to thoroughly audit and clean user contributed [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data from an area of the world. The clean map data is then imported to a NoSQL database and further explored.

File explanations here (ie XML to JSON etc)...
