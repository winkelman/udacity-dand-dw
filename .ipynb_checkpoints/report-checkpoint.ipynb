For simplicity, I chose to focus on the following keys:\n",

These types of errors occurred in only a few of the main municipalities in the Guadalajara area and were corrected with a simple search and replace function. To make sure that other city names were legitimate, I scraped data from a wikipedia page containing city names in the state of Jalisco and compared them with those encountered in the OpenStreetMap file (see `scrape_cities.py`). If the city name was not in this list, it was omitted.  Below is an audit (value and number of occurrences) of the city names containing the word 'Guadalajara'."
